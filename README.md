## What is Reseepe?
Reseepe is an innovative image classification-based android application designed to recommend dishes to users based on the ingredients they have on hand. By using advanced image recognition technology, users can take photos of their ingredients, which the app analyzes to create a comprehensive list. It then searches its recipe database to suggest dishes that match the identified ingredients, considering user preferences and dietary restrictions. Reseepe also provides detailed cooking instructions, nutritional information, and tips. This helps reduce food waste, save time and money, and inspire culinary creativity.
