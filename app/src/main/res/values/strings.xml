    <string name="desc_ex">Indonesian fried rice, known as Nasi Goreng, is a flavorful stir-fried rice dish. It\'s different from other fried rice variations because it uses a special sweet soy sauce called kecap manis, which gives it a unique sweet and savory taste.  It often includes ingredients like shrimp paste for umami, aromatics like shallots and garlic, and protein like chicken or shrimp. </string>
